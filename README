This is a game I developed with a friend who is learning Python and OOP. I
tried to make small, incremental commits to show why you want to move code
written in a functional or recipe style into objects. As the code became more
complicated, I moved it all into a package. We are going to make some more
changes to it over time.

It's surprising what you can do in a few hour's time!
